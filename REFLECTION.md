## Frontend Reflection

This project helped me better understand how a React frontend communicates with a backend API. I learned how to manage authentication state using Context and how to protect routes based on user roles.

One challenge was handling authorization errors when tokens were missing or expired. Solving this helped me understand how Axios interceptors work.

Adding charts to the admin dashboard helped me practice displaying data visually and made the application feel more professional.

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience building a complete full-stack application from start to finish.
